The assignment is about 

Surprise Housing, a US-based housing company wanted to enter the Australian housing market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. YA regression model was built using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
